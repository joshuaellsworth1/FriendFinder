#How-to
This application is called Friend Finder. The objective of the app is to have the user log their name and responses to questions. The app will then take in the responses and loop through an array of pre-set "friends" to see which match each other. The app will calculate the difference between the results. Once the app finds the closest match, it will display a modal with the name of the "friend" and their picture.
